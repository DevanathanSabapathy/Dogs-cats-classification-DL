This is my first project in Deep Learning where I used TensorFlow - Keras to classify dogs and cats.

Initially trained the model using 5 hidden layers. Resulted in a accuracy of 69% in the validation set and showed signs of overfitting.

Later used the trademark VGG16 model to predict my data. Resulted in a accuracy of 98% in the validation set.
